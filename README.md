## Why I Built Clara

I wanted to create a **safe, actually helpful AI health buddy**-something that’s approachable, privacy conscious, and genuinely useful. 

Clara:

- ✅ She listens like a companion  
- ✅ She responds with empathy and simple language  
- ✅ She nudges, but never replaces professional healthcare advice

## What Clara Can Do

Here’s how she helps:

- **Symptom guidance:**  
  *Example:* “My head hurts and I feel hot” → Clara suggests rest, hydration, asks follow ups, and reminds you to check your temperature.  

- **Minor injuries:**  
  *Example:* “I think I twisted my ankle” → Clara suggests the RICE method (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) + “See a doctor if swelling persists.”  

- **Follow up questions and friendly tone**  
  She chats like a human, uses emojis, and always keeps the tone light.
